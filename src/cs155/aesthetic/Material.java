/**
 * This represents a material (either inside or outside on an object) it
 * contains Color3D values for the emissive, ambient, diffuse, and specular
 * reflection properties of the material as well as a hardness coefficient for
 * the specular reflection. In addition, it specifies how much of the light
 * coming from that point is generated by the reflection ray, and how much from
 * the refraction ray (both values between 0 and 1 summing to less than 1), the
 * remainder comes from the material itself. Finally, it specifies the material
 * texture and the extent to which the texture is averaged with the other
 * material colors.
